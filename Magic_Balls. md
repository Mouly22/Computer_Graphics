Design a box with the following functionalities and ensure they all work independently and in any combination. Check out the gifs along with instructions for better understanding.


``` ```
The right button click on a mouse will generate random movable points with different  colours  going  in   any   random   direction   diagonally. For instance, if a point is generated at (0,0), it can go to (-1, 1), (-1, -1), (1,1), or (1, -1), and so on. The  points should be spawned where the  right button  click will be given in the box and the colour and direction of movement should be random.
```



ii. Pressing the “up arrow” key on the keyboard will increase the speed of all
the points generated so far and pressing the “down  arrow” key on the
keyboard will decrease the speed.
iii. The left button click on a mouse will make the points blink i.e. if a point is
in red, it will go background colour(here it’s black) and return to red, and
this transition should take place within a second while the transition cycle
goes on.
iv. Pressing the “Spacebar” on the keyboard should freeze all the points and
none   of   the   above   functionalities   will   work   when   frozen.   The   same
“Spacebar” should unfreeze them.
